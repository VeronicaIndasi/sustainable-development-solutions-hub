# sustainable-development-solutions-hub


The Sustainable Development Solutions Hub project aims to create a collaborative platform where innovators can propose tech solutions for sustainable development issues like waste management, renewable energy, etc. Here's a simplified explanation of its components and workflow:

Core Idea

The platform allows users to:
Submit solutions to problems related to sustainable development.
Vote on solutions (upvoting system) to highlight popular or impactful ideas.
Comment and discuss solutions for community feedback and improvements.
Track the progress of these solutions over time.

Features
Solution Submission: Users can fill out a form with details about their proposed solution, which gets stored in the database and displayed on the platform.
Upvoting: A voting mechanism allows users to "upvote" the best ideas. JavaScript handles the frontend logic for voting, and Node.js communicates with the MySQL database to track the votes.
Commenting System: Users can leave feedback on solutions, allowing for community discussion and improvement. Comments are stored in the MySQL database.
Solution Tracking: Solutions can have statuses like “Under Review” or “In Progress” to help users track the implementation stage.

User Flow
Submit Solution: Users log in, access a form, and submit their idea.
Community Engagement: Users browse solutions, upvote, and leave comments.
Improvement: The innovator can modify their solution based on community feedback.
